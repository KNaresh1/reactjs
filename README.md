# reactjs

React is a javascript library to show html content and handle user interactions.

#### Redux
React can work by itself, it can also work with libraries, databases, packages, servers etc to make development easier and simpler instead of writing from scratch.

#### class
Java script classes are part of ES215 (a spec for java script), React components are built using java script classes or functions.

#### JSX
It looks like html and can be placed inside javascipt code. Determines content of React app just like html.

#### Event handlers
Used to detect user interaction and respond to it

#### React and ReactDOM
React split into two libraries, React: knows what a component is and how to make component work together. ReactDOM: knows how to take a component and make it show up in the DOM.

#### Generate local React project
Install nodeJS -> install create-reat-app -> Generate a proj -> build proj

#### Dependencies
Webpack, Babel, Dev Server

#### Babel
Most browser support ES5 (old version of java script), babel converts any latest version eg.ES2017 into ES5 that most browsers can support. Also used to process JSX code.

#### Commands
	npm install -g create-react-app -> create-react-app <name-of-proj>
	or npx create-react-app <name-of-proj>

	npm start
